## Project Description: 
The purpose of this project is to generate choropleths at the state and county levels of the number of COVID-19 cases in the US, similar in spirit to those found on the Wikipedia page titled ["2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/COVID-19_outbreak_USA_per_capita_cases_map_counties.svg), along with other visualizations depicting the virus's dynamics in the US as a whole, by regions, and other areas of interest. I would also like to animate the time series data to visualize how the virus spread according to different metrics such as new cases per day and cumulative number of cases. If possible, I am interested in seeing how the number of cases relates to: 
- population density (i.e. are larger cities affected more severely) 
- economic disparity 
- race 
- political orientation 

etc (at least at a naive level).

## Sources of COVID-19 data:
